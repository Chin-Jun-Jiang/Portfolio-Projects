Data Exploration (SQL) & Visualisation (Tableau): COVID-19 Data <br/>

In this project, SQL Server was used to explore the global Covid 19 Data which are visualised on a Tableau Dashboard. The interactive visualisation provides insights to the readers about the extent of Covid-19 through infection and mortality counts, vaccination progress for each country through percentage of population partly vaccinated and lastly, to highlight the disparity in vaccination progress with respect to the country's income group.<br/>
