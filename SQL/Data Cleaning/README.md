Data Cleaning (SQL):Singapore's Population <br/>

In this project, SQL was used to raw data that contained information of Singapore's population from 1957 to 2019. The raw data was cleaned by removing duplicated data in higher levels of aggregation, extracting and allocating proper columns from a column filled with an amalagation of information and lastly, rectifying the inconsistent data unit.
